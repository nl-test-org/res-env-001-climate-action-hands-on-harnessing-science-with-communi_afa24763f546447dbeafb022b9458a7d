Summary
-------

Objective: Provide an overview of citizen science and other collaborative approaches to science-based climate action.

Session structure: Two hours in a classroom, consisting of several lecture segments with Q&A.

Part 1: Climate Action Meets Community Science
----------------------------------------------

Review the goals and structure of the overall course, followed by two talks exploring the drivers of citizen science and community science, associated analytical methods and data collection.

Instructors: Rajesh Kasturirangan ([ClimateX](https://climatex.mit.edu/)), Britta Voss (USGS fellow), Jeff Warren ([Public Lab](https://publiclab.org/))

Outline:

*   Community science: Why climate science needs a community approach (Britta Voss)
    *   Public disconnect from research and researchers, need for sustained & geographically distributed environmental monitoring, practical need to address immediate challenges facing frontline communities.
    *   Slides: [Community Science (PDF - 1.2MB)]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/session-1-citizen-science-and-climate-action/mitres_env_001iap17_ses1.1)
*   Renegotiating Expertise: Public Lab (Jeff Warren)
    *   What are the objectives, how does it work, who participates, who sets the agenda, what types of questions can be answered, what are the challenges, how is it different from / complementary to "traditional" research.

Part 2: Stories from the Field—Methane Leaks
--------------------------------------------

Introduce and discuss a specific example of citizen science field work: methane leaks from the natural gas infrastructure.

Instructors: [Nathan Phillips](https://www.bu.edu/earth/people/faculty/nathan-phillips/) (Boston University), Audrey Schulman ([HEET](https://www.heetma.org/))

Outline:

*   Why are methane leaks a problem for climate and the environment?
*   Why do leaks happen?
*   How are leaks detected, tracked, and repaired?
*   How can citizens get engaged?
